# Keylogger_python
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records keystrokes on a computer without the user's knowledge. Using Python, I have created a basic keylogger using various modules and techniques. Implemented robust privacy measures and leveraged analytics to enhance user experience, accessibility, and personalization. However, it's important to note that using keyloggers without proper authorization is illegal and a breach of privacy.
